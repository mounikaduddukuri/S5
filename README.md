# S5
Assignment 5
```
S5-1
Targets:
1.setup model
2.Setup learning path 
3. Summarizing the model 
4. using leaky relu 
5. using the Adam
Results:
1. weights , summaries,Trainable params and the accuracy is obtained 
Analysis:we can set the model stable and can also underfit by using hyper parametera tuning
